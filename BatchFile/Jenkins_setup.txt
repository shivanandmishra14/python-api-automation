For MAC:
For environment variable just write "env" in Job->Build->Execute shell and save it 

The environment variables displayed in Jenkins (Manage Jenkins -> System information) are inherited from the system (i.e. inherited environment variables)

If you run env command in a shell you should see the same environment variables as Jenkins shows.

These variables are either set by the shell/system.
